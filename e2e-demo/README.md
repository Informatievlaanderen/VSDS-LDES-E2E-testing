# LDES end-to-end tests
These end-to-end (E2E) tests illustrate that the LDES components work as expected from an end-to-end perspective. They are also used to demonstrate the usage and correct working of these components during the sprint demo's.

Next to running them manually, we try to automate them as much as possible. The automated tests also serve as living documentation and are therefore specified in [Gherkin language](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/) while the supporting step definitions are written in TypeScript.
