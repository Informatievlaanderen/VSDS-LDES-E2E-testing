# E2E Tests
These following end-to-end tests currently exist:
* [Use Case Related Tests](./use-cases/README.md) and their [shared contexts](./support/context/README.md)
* [Independent Demos](./demos/README.md)

> **Note**: all the tests use [Docker](http://www.docker.io) as a container technology, and therefore some knowledge is required.
