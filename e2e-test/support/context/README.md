# E2E test contexts

This folder contains a couple of system context examples used for the use cases.
* the [simulator / workflow / sink](./simulator-workflow-sink/README.md) context is used for validating the LDES client
* the [simulator / workflow / server / mongo](./simulator-workflow-server-mongo/README.md) context is used for validating the LDES server
