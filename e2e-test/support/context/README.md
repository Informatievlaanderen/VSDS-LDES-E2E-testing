# E2E Test Contexts

This folder contains a couple of system context examples used for the use cases.
* the [Simulator / Workflow / Sink](./simulator-workflow-sink/README.md) context is used for validating the LDES client
* the [Simulator / Workflow / Server / Mongo](./simulator-workflow-server-mongo/README.md) context is used for validating the LDES server
