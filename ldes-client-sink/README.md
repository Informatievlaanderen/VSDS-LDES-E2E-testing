# E2E Test Sink
The E2E test sink is a small http server used for E2E testing the LDES client NiFi processor.

## Docker
The sink can be run as a docker container, after creating a docker image for it. The docker container will keep running until stopped.

To create a docker image, run the following command:
```bash
docker build --tag vsds/sink .
```

To run the sink docker image mapped on port 9000, you can use:
```bash
docker run -d -p 9000:80 vsds/sink
```

The docker run command will return a container ID (e.g. `0cc5d65d8108f8e91778a0a4cdb6504a2b3926055ce10cb899dceb98db4c3eef`), which you need to stop the container.

Alternatively you can run `docker ps` to retrieve the (short version of the) container ID.
 ```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE       COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                    NAMES
0cc5d65d8108   vsds/sink   "/usr/bin/dumb-init â€¦"   12 seconds ago   Up 11 seconds   0.0.0.0:9000->80/tcp   intelligent_bell
 ```
To stop the container, you need to call the stop command with the (long or short) container ID, e.g. `docker stop 0cc5d65d8108`

## Build
The sink is implemented as a [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) application.
You need to run the following commands to build it:
```bash
npm i
npm run build
```

## Run
The sink takes the following command line arguments:
* `--port=<port-number>` allows to set the port, defaults to 8080
* `--host=<host-name>` allows to set the hostname, defaults to localhost
* `--silent` prevents any console debug output

You can run it with one of the following command after building it:
```bash
npm start
node dist/server.js
node dist/server.js --silent
node dist/server.js --port=6789
node dist/server.js --port=6789 --silent
```

## Usage
The sink server accepts the following REST calls.

### `GET /` -- Retrieve number of ingested members
Returns the number of members received, e.g.
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/
```
returns:
```json
{
    "count":0
}
```

### `POST /member` -- Ingest members
Ingests a member as quads (mime-type: `application/n-quads`) and returns the member ID (URI), e.g.
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/member -H "Content-Type: application/n-quads" -d "@donald-duck.nq"
```
returns:
```
http://example.org/id/cartoon-figure/donald-duck
```

### `GET /member` -- Get member list
Returns the list of members (as local URLs), e.g.
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/member
```
returns:
```json
[
    "/member?id=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.org%2Fid%2Fcartoon-figure%2Fdonald-duck"
]
```

### `GET /member?id=<url-encoded-member-id>` -- Get member content
Returns the member content as quads (mime-type: `application/n-quads`), e.g.
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/member?id=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.org%2Fid%2Fcartoon-figure%2Fdonald-duck
```
returns:
```
<http://example.org/id/cartoon-figure/donald-duck> <http://schema.org/name> "Donald Duck" .
<http://example.org/id/cartoon-figure/donald-duck> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://schema.org/Person> .
